# SpellingBee
A bot for New York Times' Spelling Bee that optionally automatically types the words in for you

Unfiltered_words.txt has the full dictionary, filtered.txt is written after running the program and inputting the center and outward letters (and reset when ran again). 
Saying "yes" when prompted to write will sleep for 2 seconds and write every word in filtered.txt.

The dictionary is NOT the same as spelling-bees dictionary. A potential improvement is to order unfiltered_words.txt by word frequency, leading to the words being inputted in the same order (and less incorrect guesses), but I'm happy with it now.[filtered.txt](https://github.com/Joaofelipe2502/SpellingBee/files/10831855/filtered.txt)
